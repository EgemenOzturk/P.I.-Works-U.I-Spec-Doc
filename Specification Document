2. UI designs
2.1	User Screen


User screen will have the managers to have an option to list all users by their ID, User Name, Email, Enabled Status, and they also sort these listings by alphabetical order. There is a functional navigation bar that allows managers to add new users, hide Disabled Users, and Save User. Adding new user requires brief information about the very new user. The necessary informations are, username, display name, phone number, personal e-mail, user’s role, and Enabled Status.

This is the specification document for the user management screen's user interface. It provides the specifications, information about the UI components, how the website behaves while utilizing these components, what to display to the user first, etc. The software engineers that create this user interface will refer to this document.
